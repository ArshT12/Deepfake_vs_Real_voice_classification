| **TTS Coverage** | Incorporation of multiple synthesis engines and architectural approaches | Enable detection of artifacts across various voice cloning methods, from traditional concatenative to modern neural approaches | Selected 59-91 distinct TTS systems from MLAAD spanning commercial, open-source, and research implementations |
| **Recording Conditions** | Mixture of studio-quality and noisy/reverberant recordings | Ensure robustness against variable background noise, microphone quality, and acoustic environments | Combined clean studio recordings with "in-the-wild" audio featuring ambient noise, reverberation, and variable recording equipment |
| **Modal Context** | Inclusion of both audio-only and audio extracted from audiovisual fakes | Train specialized detection strategies that account for cross-modal optimization artifacts | Extracted audio from FakeAVCeleb to capture lip-sync optimized speech generation patterns |
| **Data Volume & Balance** | Sufficient sample counts per class with uniform chunking methodology | Prevent overfitting and skewed learning in model training | Implemented strategic sampling to balance representation while maintaining sufficient volume |
| **Temporal Diversity** | Variable-length samples that capture both short-term spectral and long-term prosodic features | Ensure models can detect artifacts at multiple temporal scales | Chunked source material into 5-10 second segments to balance context and computational efficiency |
| **Feature Compatibility** | Consideration of downstream feature extraction requirements | Facilitate extraction of standard acoustic features proven in speech processing | Maintained uniform sampling rate (22.05 kHz) and bit depth (16-bit PCM) across sources |

By systematically mapping each data source against these criteria, we developed a multi-faceted dataset that maximizes coverage across critical dimensions of variation in both real and synthetic speech.

## 4.4 Strategic Class Distribution and Balancing

Our dataset maintains a slight imbalance (53.5% real vs. 46.5% fake) by deliberate design rather than limitation. This decision was made to address several important considerations:

### 4.4.1 Rationale for Class Distribution
- **Reflection of real-world scenarios**: The slight predominance of real samples better reflects operational contexts where most audio is genuine
- **Quality over artificial balance**: Maintained all high-quality fake samples rather than artificially reducing them to achieve perfect balance
- **Algorithmic compensation**: Implemented class weighting in training protocols to ensure unbiased learning

### 4.4.2 Multi-Dimensional Balancing Strategy
We implemented sophisticated multi-dimensional balancing to prevent domain bias:

- **Source-type balance**:
  
  | Source Category | Real Samples | Fake Samples | Real % | Fake % |
  |----------------|-------------|-------------|--------|--------|
  | Read Speech | 35,410 | 33,217 | 35.0% | 37.7% |
  | Conversational | 41,480 | 36,741 | 41.0% | 41.7% |
  | Entertainment | 24,282 | 18,091 | 24.0% | 20.6% |

- **Recording quality distribution**:
  
  | Quality Level | Real Samples | Fake Samples | Combined % |
  |--------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
  | Studio | 42,492 | 45,786 | 46.7% |
  | Semi-professional | 31,363 | 28,176 | 31.5% |
  | Amateur/Field | 27,317 | 14,087 | 21.8% |

### 4.4.3 Training Implementation Considerations
To address the slight class imbalance during model training, we employ:

- **Class weight calculation**: w_c = N_samples / (n_classes * n_c)
- **Stratified sampling**: Ensuring fold creation maintains class proportions
- **Balanced batch generation**: Sampling techniques during training to ensure balanced mini-batches
- **Performance metrics**: Focus on balanced accuracy, F1 score, and AUC rather than raw accuracy
