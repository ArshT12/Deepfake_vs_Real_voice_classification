## 1. Introduction

The proliferation of deepfake audio presents significant challenges for authentication systems and information integrity. This project explores the application of XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting framework, to detect synthetic voice audio by analyzing acoustic features extracted from audio samples.

The primary goals of this analysis are:
- Evaluate the performance of XGBoost models through cross-validation
- Identify optimal hyperparameters through systematic tuning
- Analyze feature importance to understand key acoustic indicators
- Optimize classification thresholds for deployable models
- Create a robust, production-ready model for real-time deepfake voice detection

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Dataset and Features

The dataset comprises audio samples labeled as either real (1) or fake (0). Features extracted from these audio samples include:

- **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)**: Both means and standard deviations (mfcc_mean_1 through mfcc_mean_13 and mfcc_std_1 through mfcc_std_13)
- **Zero-crossing rate (zcr)**: Rate at which the signal changes from positive to negative
- **Root mean square (rms)**: Signal energy
- **Spectral features**: Including spectral centroid, bandwidth, rolloff, and contrast
- **Pitch statistics**: Including mean and standard deviation

### 2.2 Model Development Process

The development process followed these steps:
1. Data preprocessing and feature scaling
2. Cross-validation for initial performance assessment
3. Hyperparameter tuning through grid search
4. Final model training and evaluation
5. Threshold analysis for optimal decision boundaries
6. Model persistence for deployment

## 3. Cross-Validation Results
A 5-fold cross-validation approach was implemented to evaluate model performance stability:

```python
n_splits = 5
kf = KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
cv_scores = []

for train_index, val_index in kf.split(X_train_scaled):
    # Split the data
    X_cv_train, X_cv_val = X_train_scaled[train_index], X_train_scaled[val_index]
    y_cv_train, y_cv_val = y_train.iloc[train_index], y_train.iloc[val_index]
    
    # Train the model
    cv_model = XGBClassifier(use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric="logloss", random_state=42)
    cv_model.fit(X_cv_train, y_cv_train)
    
    # Predict and evaluate
    y_cv_pred = cv_model.predict(X_cv_val)
    f1 = f1_score(y_cv_val, y_cv_pred)
    cv_scores.append(f1)
```

The cross-validation results showed consistent performance across folds:

| Fold | Accuracy |
|------|----------|
| 1    | 0.9571   |
| 2    | 0.9520   |
| 3    | 0.9568   |
| 4    | 0.9548   |
| 5    | 0.9543   |

Mean Accuracy: 0.9550  
Standard Deviation: 0.0018

The low standard deviation (0.0018) indicates that the model performance is stable across different subsets of the training data.

## 4. Hyperparameter Tuning
A systematic grid search was conducted to identify the optimal hyperparameters for the XGBoost model:

### 4.1 Hyperparameter Search Grid
The following hyperparameters were explored:

- max_depth: [3, 7]
- learning_rate: [0.05, 0.1]
- n_estimators: [100, 200]

### 4.2 Tuning Results
The grid search produced the following CV scores for each parameter combination:

| Parameters | Mean CV Score |
|------------|---------------|
| max_depth=3, lr=0.05, n_est=100 | 0.8362 (±0.0026) |
| max_depth=3, lr=0.1, n_est=100  | 0.8674 (±0.0023) |
| max_depth=7, lr=0.05, n_est=100 | 0.9223 (±0.0027) |
| max_depth=7, lr=0.1, n_est=100  | 0.9402 (±0.0018) |
| max_depth=3, lr=0.05, n_est=200 | 0.8660 (±0.0022) |
| max_depth=3, lr=0.1, n_est=200  | 0.8920 (±0.0030) |
| max_depth=7, lr=0.05, n_est=200 | 0.9401 (±0.0019) |
| max_depth=7, lr=0.1, n_est=200  | 0.9552 (±0.0011) |

### 4.3 Optimal Hyperparameters
The best performing combination was:

- max_depth: 7
- learning_rate: 0.1
- n_estimators: 200

This configuration achieved a mean CV score of 0.9552 (±0.0011), representing a significant improvement over the baseline model.

### 4.4 Analysis of Hyperparameter Impact
Based on the results, several insights can be drawn:

- **max_depth**: Highest importance (8.21% variation in score). Increasing max_depth from 3 to 7 significantly improved performance, suggesting the data has complex decision boundaries that benefit from deeper trees.
- **learning_rate**: Moderate importance (2.50% variation in score). Higher learning rates (0.1 vs 0.05) consistently improved performance, indicating that the model benefits from more aggressive updates during training.
- **n_estimators**: Lowest importance (2.42% variation in score). More estimators (200 vs 100) consistently improved performance, showing that the model benefits from more trees in the ensemble.

Parameter synergy: The combination of deeper trees, higher learning rates, and more estimators worked synergistically to achieve the best performance.

## 5. Learning Curve Analysis
The learning curve shows the model's performance as a function of training set size:

### 5.1 Learning Curve Interpretation
The learning curve reveals several important insights:

- **Training Score (Red Line)**: The model achieves very high training scores (0.988-1.0) across all training set sizes, which might indicate potential overfitting. However, the validation scores also remain high, suggesting the model generalizes well despite fitting the training data closely.

- **Validation Score (Green Line)**: The validation score improves as the training set size increases, rising from approximately 0.933 at 10% of data to 0.955 at 100% of data. This steady improvement indicates that the model benefits from additional training data.

- **Convergence**: The validation curve begins to plateau as the training set size approaches 100%, suggesting diminishing returns from adding more training data at this point.

- **Gap Analysis**: The gap between training and validation performance (0.0341) indicates some overfitting, but it's minimal and within acceptable limits for this application.

- **Data Sufficiency**: The validation curve's plateau suggests that the current dataset size is adequate for this problem, though modest gains might still be possible with additional data.

## 6. Feature Importance Analysis
The feature importance analysis reveals which acoustic features are most influential in the model's decisions:

### 6.1 Top Features
The most important features in the final model are:

1. **mfcc_mean_10** (0.111563): The most important feature by far
2. **mfcc_mean_8** (0.068096): Second most important feature
3. **mfcc_std_3** (0.056531): Third most important feature
4. **zcr** (0.048315): Zero-crossing rate, an important temporal feature
5. **mfcc_std_2** (0.045950): Standard deviation of the 2nd MFCC coefficient

### 6.2 Feature Importance by Category
When grouped by category, the relative importance is:

1. **MFCC Mean** (0.439450): The most important category
2. **MFCC Std** (0.344658): Second most important category
3. **Spectral** (0.099964): Third most important category
4. **Energy** (0.078303): Fourth most important category
5. **Pitch** (0.037625): Least important category

### 6.3 Feature Importance Interpretation
The prominence of MFCC features (both means and standard deviations) indicates that spectral envelope characteristics are the most discriminative for detecting deepfake voices. Key insights include:

- **Spectral envelope representation**: MFCCs capture the spectral envelope of the audio signal, which appears to differ significantly between real and synthetic voices.

- **Temporal signal characteristics**: The zero-crossing rate's importance suggests artificial voices have different temporal patterns than human voices.

- **Spectral energy distribution**: Features like spectral bandwidth and contrast capture how energy is distributed across frequencies, which appears to differ between real and synthetic voices.

- **Coefficient variations**: The importance of MFCC standard deviations suggests that the variability in spectral characteristics is a strong indicator, with fake voices likely showing different patterns of variation.

## 7. Final Model Performance
The final model trained with optimal hyperparameters achieved excellent performance:

### 7.1 Performance Metrics (Default Threshold = 0.5)
| Metric    | Value   |
|-----------|---------|
| Accuracy  | 0.9591  |
| Precision | 0.9572  |
| Recall    | 0.9549  |
| F1 Score  | 0.9561  |

This represents an improvement over the baseline model:
- Accuracy: +0.58%
- F1 Score: +0.63%

### 7.2 Threshold Analysis
The default classification threshold (0.5) already provides excellent performance, but threshold optimization can further balance precision and recall for specific use cases:

| Threshold | Accuracy | Precision | Recall  | F1 Score |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| 0.10      | 0.8941   | 0.8162    | 0.9969  | 0.8976   |
| 0.20      | 0.9341   | 0.8826    | 0.9900  | 0.9332   |
| 0.30      | 0.9513   | 0.9189    | 0.9820  | 0.9494   |
| 0.40      | 0.9583   | 0.9415    | 0.9707  | 0.9559   |
| 0.45      | 0.9590   | 0.9496    | 0.9629  | 0.9562   |
| 0.50      | 0.9591   | 0.9572    | 0.9549  | 0.9561   |
| 0.60      | 0.9557   | 0.9685    | 0.9353  | 0.9516   |
| 0.70      | 0.9469   | 0.9789    | 0.9054  | 0.9407   |
| 0.80      | 0.9290   | 0.9862    | 0.8596  | 0.9185   |
| 0.90      | 0.8855   | 0.9928    | 0.7595  | 0.8606   |
| 0.95      | 0.8310   | 0.9965    | 0.6391  | 0.7787   |

Key observations:

- **Optimal threshold**: The highest F1 score (0.9562) is achieved at a threshold of 0.45, slightly improving upon the default threshold.

- **Precision-recall tradeoff**: As the threshold increases, precision improves at the expense of recall. At threshold=0.95, precision reaches 0.9965 (almost no false positives) but recall drops to 0.6391.

- **Use case considerations**:
  - For applications requiring minimal false positives (e.g., security-critical systems), higher thresholds (0.8-0.95) may be preferred.
  - For applications requiring minimal false negatives (e.g., screening tools), lower thresholds (0.3-0.45) would be more appropriate.

### 7.3 ROC and Precision-Recall Analysis

The model achieved exceptional ROC and Precision-Recall curves:

- **ROC AUC**: 0.9927 (very close to perfect classification)
- **PR AUC**: 0.9912 (excellent precision-recall tradeoff)

These metrics confirm the model's robustness and effectiveness across different operating thresholds.

## 8. Conclusions and Recommendations

### 8.1 Key Findings
- **Model effectiveness**: XGBoost achieves exceptional performance in distinguishing real from fake voice audio, with 95.90% accuracy and 95.62% F1 score at the optimal threshold of 0.45.

- **Critical features**: MFCC features (both means and standard deviations) are the most powerful indicators for detecting synthetic voices, accounting for over 78% of total feature importance.
